# spotify-hub

## Mission
Chrome extension for new tab pages that shows users spotify information and other productivity gadgets. 
Users can see their basic spotify analytical information as well as time, date, and a todo list. 
Bonus: playlist recommender based on user listening data and todo list keywords also being implemented.

## Setup/Documentations to Look At

#### Spotify App Creation
Followed these directions [here](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/quick-start/) I went to my dashboard and created Hubbify! app.
Then looked at [this](https://medium.com/@jonnykalambay/now-playing-using-spotifys-awesome-api-with-react-7db8173a7b13) tutorial for understanding connecting to react.
A really important part of the tutorial is about authorization scopes which can be found [here](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/scopes/).

#### Version Control
Give me your github email and Ill add you as a collaborator. Then youll get an email confirmation and click accept. then you can just copy the https clone link and git clone that in a safe local folder. Now you can use terminal to modify and push changes from local to this repository.

#### React App
[Initial Creation](https://medium.com/@gilfink/building-a-chrome-extension-using-react-c5bfe45aaf36): sudo npm install -g create-react-app hub

This creates a folder called hub with a basic react app. here we need to add manifest.json in public folder, and any other stuff that we want to show up in our build file..
We put our js files in src. After we have changes to our react app, we want to build it with [npm run build]. This creates a build folder. This is the folder we want to unload pack for extension.


#### IGNORE Python Virtual Environment
We need to setup a python virtual environment to test our web app. virtual environment can be really useful to maintain dependencies.
To restart this portion: use this command in root folder: rm -rf env

1.) python3 -m venv env
2.) source env/bin/activate
3.) check if its good: echo $VIRTUAL_ENV
4.) upgrade python tools in env: pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel

From now on, activate python env (step 2) before we test or run anything.

#### IGNORE Install React/JS environment 
1.) source env/bin/activate
2.) pip install nodeenv
3.) nodeenv --python-virtualenv
4.) deactivate
5.) source env/bin/activate

#### Bash Scripts
This is just fast command line commands that we want to automate. First chmod +x [bin/test_script] or whatever file, and then try running in cmd line with ./bin/test_script. if you get a weird $/r error, do [sudo apt-get install dos2unix] and then [dos2unix bin/test_script]. ONLY FOR WINDOWS. THen you should be able to run them.

#### Chrome Extension Documentation
[Getting Started with Extensions](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted)


## Login Screen
When user first downloads the extension, we want the user to see a beautiful new tab layout, but also give the user the option to input their spotify account to get started. ANY issue or "hacky" web path will redirect to this html.

Contains:
* Time and Date
* Short description of hub
* Login bar
* Bonus: add a playable list of top songs based on network location

## Login attempt Informational Screen?
Add if we need legal documents shown to the user. If not go directly to the main page.

## Main page
Everytime a user opens a new tab, they will see this page (after they logged in with spotify).

### Layout:
* [Spotify Account name and image](#spotify-account-name-and-image)
* [Time and Date](#time-and-date)
* [Total Listen Hours](#total-listen-hours)
* [Show Users Top Artists and Tracks](#show-users-top-artists-and-tracks)
* [Recommendation Playlist](#recommendation-playlist)
* [Settings Bar](#settings)

### Spotify Account Name and Image
[Spotify API Guide](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/users-profile/get-users-profile/)

Get Username and Image from this API. IF no image, use a default image.

### Time and Date
Dynamic clientside time and date. Time always updating. ex 8:38

ADD: Hover over time to show timezone

### Total Listen Hours
Not sure if this possible atm. If it is add it.

### Show Users Top Artists and Tracks
Shows users top ten artist and tracks of the last 6 months.

[Spotify Api Guide](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/personalization/get-users-top-artists-and-tracks/)

We are going to want to add default values for limit (10), offset (0), and time_range (medium_term) which is last 6 months.

### Recommendation Playlist
Based on user information such as [saved tracks](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/library/get-users-saved-albums/), [saved albums](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/library/get-users-saved-albums/), [users followed artists](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/follow/get-followed/), users tops songs, and KEYWORDS.

Gather all this information, and then compile a playlist and ask the user if they want to save it to their playlists.

### Settings
* Set timezone
* maybe darkmode lightmode?
* logout button

## Offline
We want to show a pretty nice new tab page even when user is offline. Probably just a pretty tab override with time and date.
